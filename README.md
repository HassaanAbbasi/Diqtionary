# Diqtionary
Diqtionary (a combination of "Dictionary" and "IQ") is a program that returns all the definitions of a given word. However, it also has some smart built-in features:

* Provides possible words you might have meant if you input a word incorrectly
* Recognizes acronyms

To run Diqtionary, download all the files and run the "main.py" file in the "Program" directory.
